* Zig-cc
A util script that aims to ease use =zig cc= to compile C/C++/Rust/Go programs.

* Why
In most cases, we can use following command to use Zig for compile
#+begin_src bash
CC='zig cc' CXX='zig c++' ...
#+end_src
However in real world, there are many issues this way, such as:
- [[https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/4911][zig cc: parse -target and -mcpu/-march/-mtune flags according to clang #4911]]
- [[https://gist.github.com/kassane/446889ea1dd5ff07048d921f2b755e78][Targets compare: Rust to Zig]]
- [[https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aziglang%2Fzig+unsupported+linker+arg%3A&type=issues][unsupported linker arg]]
So this project was born, it will
- Convert target between Zig and Rust/Go
- Ignore link args when =zig cc= throw errors, hopefully this will make compile successfully, WIP.
* Install
Download [[file:zigcc][zigcc]] file, give it executable permission, and create two soft links =zigcxx=, =zigcargo= to it.
#+begin_src bash
curl -Lo zigcc https://github.com/jiacai2050/zig-cc/raw/main/zigcc
chmod +x zigcc
ln -s zigcc zigcxx
ln -s zigcc zigcargo
#+end_src

Then use like this
#+begin_src bash
CC=zigcc CXX=zigcxx ...
#+end_src

=zigcargo= can used to replace =cargo=, it will automatically set
- =CC= =CARGO_TARGET_<triple>_LINKER= to =zigcc=
- =CXX= to =zigcxx=
